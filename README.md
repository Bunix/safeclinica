# safeclinica
SafeClinica is an Electronic Medical Record System suitable for low resource settings.
It is made for clinics with single computer or tablet mostly at the registration. The application is made with Laravel 5.4 using Eloquent ORM primarily while views are strictly in Blade. The styling is basicaly done using a free template caled Paper Theme obtained on the wilds of the internet.


We have also set it for scalling up, it can also be deployed in a setting where there is more than one computer or tablet. In this setting different modules can be accessed by different people in the clinic. It currently hosts the capacity for:

1- Registration

2- Doctor's room

3- Pharmacy

4- Laboratory

5- Management
